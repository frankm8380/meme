		<h2>🤔 Why This Site?</h2>
		<p>
			This site was inspired by the absurdity of modern politics, the hypocrisy of some of its key players, 
			and the gaslighting tactics used by Trump and Musk. Their ability to manipulate narratives, distort 
			reality, and redefine words to suit their agenda motivated the creation of this sarcastic "fan" page.  
		</p>
		<p>
			Here, people can express their true opinions through memes, humor, and creativity—whether they 
			support these figures or want to send them a loud and clear message. 
		</p>
		<p><b>🖕 Why the Middle Finger?</b></p>
		<p>
			The middle finger salute has become a universal response to authoritarianism, corruption, 
			and billionaire ego-trips. Instead of letting them define the narrative, let's take ownership of it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since we are now allowed to redefine what gestures mean, this website follows the same logic.
			When people submit photos or videos flipping the middle finger, it is clearly meant to mean:
			<b>“Trump and Musk are number one!”</b>
		</p>
		<p><i>We are simply playing by their rules.</i></p>

		<p>
			And of course, <b>thumbs-up gestures</b> will also follow this same logic!  
			If a thumbs-up can now mean <i>"support,"</i> then surely a middle finger  
			can mean the <b>exact same thing</b> in this new reality.
		</p>

		<p>
			So no matter which one you choose—<b>thumbs-up or middle finger</b>—  
			you’re proudly declaring that <b>Trump and Musk are #1!</b>
		</p>

		<p>
			If this site made you laugh, roll your eyes, or feel empowered, then it’s doing exactly what it was 
			meant to do. Have fun and let your voice be heard!
